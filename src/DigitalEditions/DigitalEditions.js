            Our goal with The Digital Milliet Project is to make ancient Greek and Latin texts
            about painting accessible in an attractive and intuitive open-source interface.
            Painting was an essential part of ancient art but most of the works have been
            destroyed by the passing of time.
            The Digital Milliet project revitalizes the sourcebook
